# Self-Balancing-AVL-Tree-Management-System
This project is an implementation of an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. It supports various operations, including insertion, deletion, traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder), and search by ID or name. The program is designed to maintain balance for efficient operations, featuring rotation mechanisms for rebalancing.
